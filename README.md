# Microsoft-Office-Mini-Projects
In this project, I was tasked with completing five different assignments that covered a variety of tools and techniques. The first task was done in Word, where I demonstrated my skills with all the major functionalities of the program, such as formatting, table creation, headers, footers, and managing references and citations. The second assignment required me to create a timetable in Excel, organizing data efficiently and applying formatting features for readability. For the third task, I worked with PowerPivot in Excel to analyze and model large datasets, and I also completed the same analysis without using PowerPivot to compare the differences in performance and functionality. The fourth task was completed using LaTeX, where I wrote a document that showcased my ability to create structured, professional-quality reports with mathematical formulas, tables, and references. The final task involved the creation of a website in SharePoint, where I developed a SharePoint site, incorporating features such as document management, lists, and automating processes, thus allowing me to showcase my skills in SharePoint integration and customization.
